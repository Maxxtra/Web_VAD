Flask API: Voice Activity Detection

All the backend is made entirely in Python. It is an Website with 3 pages: home, detection, evaluation. You can choose at every step which of these VADs to use and in the pages of selection you will find buttons that will rederict you specific to every github repository of every model. On the page of /detection you can choose only one at a time VAD to use, but in the /evaluation you can choose up to every VAD that are there. 

On the page of /evaluation an interactive graph with all the necesary data will pop-up. It evaluates based on Precision and Recall.
